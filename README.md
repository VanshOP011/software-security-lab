**Software Security Experiments**
This repository contains a set of practical experiments focused on identifying, exploiting, and mitigating common software security vulnerabilities. The aim is to understand real-world security flaws and implement secure coding practices.

**Objectives**: Understand common web application vulnerabilities Perform hands-on exploitation in a controlled environment Learn secure coding techniques to prevent attacks Compare insecure vs secure implementations

**Experiments Included**
SQL Injection Demonstrates authentication bypass using SQL injection Vulnerable login system using raw queries Secure version using prepared statements.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Stored XSS using input fields (e.g., shoutbox/comments) Execution of malicious scripts in browser Secure version with input sanitization and output encoding.

Password Hashing Weak hashing using MD5 / plain text storage Secure hashing using SHA-256 with salt Highlights the importance of password protection.

Network Traffic Analysis (Wireshark) Capturing HTTP login requests Observing plaintext credentials Analyzing headers and packet data Understanding risks of unencrypted communication.

Secure Authentication System Comparison of insecure vs secure login logic Implementation using parameterized queries Basic input validation and error handling.
